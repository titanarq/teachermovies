# workaround titanarq/agent-os#18 (decision A on #1, 2026-09-24): the *dispatch* side of
# scripts/clean_stale_worker.sh. That script clears a finished run's leftover
# scratchpad/progress.log so the next `worker_task.sh <backend> start` stops refusing on it, but
# something still has to decide WHEN it is safe to run it -- by hand, someone forgets, and #18
# recurs on the very next dispatch after every merge. This is the second `ExecStart=` of
# scripts/systemd/teachermovies-board-sync.service, so it rides the same 5-minute timer as the
# board sync with no separate unit to maintain (host-owned, outside `agent_os/`).
#
# For every backend `worktree-backends` lists (today: qwen, claude), runs
# `scripts/clean_stale_worker.sh <backend>` IF AND ONLY IF:
#   - `.cache/worker_<backend>.issue` names an issue, and
#   - that issue is CLOSED on GitHub (an open issue is a run still in flight: never touch it).
# `clean_stale_worker.sh` itself is the guard against the other two dangers named in issue #18's
# workaround (operations.md): it separately refuses when the worktree carries any uncommitted
# file besides the diary, or any commit on HEAD not yet on `origin/main` -- both checked again
# here first so a GitHub hiccup or an ineligible worktree never even shells out to `gh issue view`
# or touches the worktree. It only ever detaches HEAD and deletes branches already MERGED into
# origin/main (`--merged`), so an unmerged branch is never at risk from either script.
#
# Idempotent and quiet: nothing eligible (no issue file, issue still open, worktree already idle,
# or already cleaned) prints nothing and exits 0. Only an actual cleanup, or a real refusal
# (uncommitted work / unpushed commits, which `clean_stale_worker.sh` reports on its own),
# writes anything. Safe to run every 5 minutes forever; running it twice in a row after a
# cleanup is a no-op the second time (the worktree is already detached at origin/main with no
# diary, so the "nothing eligible" check above skips it).
#
# Remove alongside scripts/clean_stale_worker.sh once agent-os#18 is fixed upstream and the
# subtree is pulled (see docs/runbooks/operations.md).
